# Timer Dark Mode

In this project a Timer was created with some functions, which are:  

- Play and Pause button
- Add and Decrease Time button (5 minutes)
- 4 Cards with ambient sounds to improve the focus (With a slider to adjust the volume)
- Ligth and Dark Mode




## Learnings

In this project we learned mainly about the setTimeout function, and how to add sounds through JavaScript.

In addition, we advanced in the knowledge about callbacks, injection of dependencies into the factories, and, separation of the js files with the export and import of ES6.
